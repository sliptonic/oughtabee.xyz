What's this all about?

Have you driven past an active contruction site and wondered what's coming in? \\
Have you seen an empty building and thought, 'That would be a good place for a donut shop!'? \\
Have you wished your town had a store, restaurant or service?  
Have you ever thought....'There oughta be...'  

The oughtabee app, when launched will give users a place to voice opinions, find out about coming businesses and make suggestions for franchises and services they would like to see in their community.

The oughtabee service will give businesses and advertisers a way to reach customers at exactly the moment when curiousity is peaked.
