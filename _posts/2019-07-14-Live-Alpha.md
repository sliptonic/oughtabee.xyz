There's still plenty to do but the core application is now live and usable.
Pins can be created and moved into position.
Question pins allow answers (If you're logged in).
Most of the core mapping functions work as expected.

During the alpha phase, a feedback button is provided at the bottom of the sidebar menu.
If you find bugs, or rough patches, please send a comment and we'll fix it as soon as we can.
